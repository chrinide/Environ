New in version 1.1:

  * confinement potential introduced

  * non-linear Poisson-Bolzmann and modified Poisson-Bolzmann

  * additional interactions in diffuse layer

Problems fixed in version 1.1:

  * improved minimum image convention for generation of functions: it solves
    incorrect behavior for non-orthorombic cells

  * bugfix: laplacian of erfc was not correctly implemented for 1-D and 
    2-D systems (calculations with dielectric and 1- or 2-D system boundary 
    were affected)

  * fixed a bug in dielectric regions when optical permittivity is different from vacuum

  * decreased tolerance for check on electronic charge in utils_charges.f90
 
  * fixed a small bug that prevented compilation in environ_init.f90 

  * modified the local arrays in compute_convolution_fft to avoid 
    large automatic arrays written on the stack (segmentation fault on
    Mac with default compilation options, i.e. small stack) 

Incompatible changes in version 1.1:

  * from QE-6.4 Environ has no information on spin

  * from QE-6.3 it is no longer possible to speficy PBC correction 
    scheme of Environ using the assume_isolated keyword in the pw input file

Known problems in Environ 1.1 :

  * testset is not fully consistent between parallel and serial execution,
    and with different compilers
  
  * test pw_water/water-anion-sccs-default has convergence issues

  * charged systems in PBC without jellium show small differences between
    pcb and iter solvers

  * forces in dielectric embedding for charged systems and PBC have a 
    small error

  * sqrt preconditioner for dielectric embedding only works for analytic 
    boundary_core

  * alternative preconditioning schemes for dielectric embedding 
    are not stable, do not converge
