     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     Reading input from pw.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

               file O.pbe-rrkjus.UPF: wavefunction(s)  2S renormalized

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
